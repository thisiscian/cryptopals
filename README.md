# Cryptopals Python

My launchpad for solving the cryptopals crypto problems

## To try to solve these yourselves, using my tests, first:
1. Clone this repository, `git clone https://github.com/thisiscian/cryptopals/tree/clean cryptopals_python`
2. Run `python setup.py` to pull fresh information and create the 
    `challenges/` dir.
3. now run `python test.py` to make sure that all outputs fail
4. update `challenges/challenge_1.py` (problem url is in the file), and
   rerun `python test.py 1`, to see the output and traceback for that problem!
